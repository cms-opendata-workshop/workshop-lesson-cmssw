title: Setup
---
> Before you begin, you need to have completed either the [Virtual Machine](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop-lesson-virtualmachine/) lesson or the [Docker](https://cms-opendata-workshop.github.io/workshop-lesson-docker/) one.  In particular, you need to have a CMSSW area (in the VM or Docker container) already validated and ready to use.
